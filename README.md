# horiseon-code-refactor

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website in order to improve its accessibility and search engine optimisation. The goal was to make these changes without changing the functionality of the site.

When creating a website, it is important that it remains accessible to people who rely on assistive technologies to navigate the web. I did this by providing a text description of each image on the site, which helps a person understand an image without seeing it.

 This is called an 'alt' attribute. This attribute does not only help those with visual disabilities, it is also helpful for developers to provide context when a webpage is missing images.

 Secondly, my other aim was to replace the 'div' elements on the page with semantic elements such as 'header', 'section' and 'footer'.
 Similarly to 'alt' attributes, these semantic elements provide context for the HTML code, providing a better description of the content, making it easier for
 the developer to read and improving search engine optimisation.

 Lastly, I tried to make the CSS code shorter and easier to maintain by using the Grouping Selector where there were elements that used the same styling.

 At the top the page there are 3 headers you can click on which will direct you to a different section of the page.
